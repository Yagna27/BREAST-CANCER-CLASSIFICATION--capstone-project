# BREAST CANCER CLASSIFICATION
I used an external dataset i.e. Breast Cancer Risk Classification dataset in our Machine Learning Workspace, and trained the model using different tools available in the Microsoft Azure Workspace. I created two models, one using Automated ML module by Microsoft Azure and one Logistic Regression model whose hyperparameters are tuned using Hyperdrive. I compared their performance on the basis of their respective Weighted Average Precision Score wherein the score of the Voting Ensemble model created by AutoML was found to be 0.9150 and the Logistic Regression model as 0.104. Furthermore, I deploy the better performing model i.e. clearly the Voting Ensemble model as a web service using the Azure ML Framework.
